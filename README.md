## Inroduction
Privacy is the driving force behind this project. It uses secure technologies like WebRTC , PeerJs , SocketIO to directly connect between participants. The website that provides the web app and mediates the communication stores as few data as possible (nearly negligible) and does not know anything about the contents of established conversations. No accounts are required. No cookies are used. No data is being saved!.  

Our Conferencing Chat Room is completely decentralised and transfers your video directly to the peer you are talking to without the need of servers in the middle. This project was developed with `Angular` `NodeJs` `SocketIO`.

## Other Variant
The other varient of this web application can be found <a href="https://github.com/qazi9amaan/DecentralisedVIdeoConference/tree/node-js">here</a>. To support multiple users and for an easy and beginers implementation, same was done using `node-js` `html` `css` without any use of `angular`.
